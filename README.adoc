= Ribose API

NOTE: Ribose API documentation can be browsed at http://docs.ribose.apiary.io
in a human-friendly format.  This repository contains source files we build
that documentation from, and some build tools.  If you are going to contribute
to documentation, you are in right place.

== Contributing

=== Setting things up

Clone this repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone --recursive https://github.com/riboseinc/ribose-api
cd ribose-api
----

NOTE: The `--recursive` option initializes and pulls submodules, which are
needed to build the documentation.
See https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules[Git Book] for details.

Install dependencies:

[source,bash]
----
npm install
----

=== Compiling and validating the blueprint

For external reasons, an up-to-date blueprint compilation is required to be
checked into repository.  It is stored in `apiary.apib` file.  In order to
compile and validate `apiary.apib`, run following:

[source,bash]
----
npm run compile
----

After successful blueprint compilation, a tiny validation tool is run.  Issues,
if any, will be printed in console.

== Documentation structure

=== Transclusions

We use Hercule tool to compile `apiary.apib` from the source files.  It
introduces the concept of _transclusion_,Â which roughly means including one
document in another, at least in our simple case.

To find out more about this tool, visit https://github.com/jamesramsay/hercule.

=== Sections

Final blueprint is built from section subdocuments which reside in the
`sections/` directory.  The `input.apib` defines how that document is composed,
hence don't forget to update that file when contributing a new section.
Section subdocuments are transcluded with `:()[sections/<section-name>.apib]`
expressions.  For example, expression `:()[sections/space.apib]` will transclude
content of `sections/space.apib` file.

=== Response fixtures

Response fixtures can be imported from `spec/fixtures` directory
of the https://github.com/riboseinc/ribose-ruby[ribose-ruby] project.
They are transcluded with `:()[fixture:fixture-file-name]` expression.  For
example, `:()[fixture:spaces.json]` will resolve to `spec/fixtures/spaces.json`
in ribose-ruby project.

Under the hood, Git submodules are involved.  The ribose-ruby project is
added as a submodule in `fixtures` directory.  Run `git submodule update` to
grab the freshest content, if necessary.

If you want to read more about submodules, Git Book contains an excellent
chapter on this topic: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules

=== Comments

HTML comments can be used in document, either in `input.apib` or in any section.
They are removed at blueprint compilation.
